## General
This repository contains the data and code I used for the project "Leveraging State-Supported AI to Break Economic Dependency: Insights from Export Diversification in Chile and Thailand". This is the dissertation project I submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirement of the MSc degree in Development Studies. In this paper, I applied the synthetic control method: The data and code offered here are used to construct the results in the paper. 

### PRELIMINARY NOTES 
The original paper is the pdf file. In this project, the primary units of analysis are Chile and Thailand. However, when coding, I also explored India and South Africa. This is why there are more samples that appear in data and analysis code. 

### DATA
The csv files are the cleaned data for the analysis. For the synthetic control, there is one treated unit in each data and all others are control units. As I analyzed 4 countries, there are 4 cleaned data to construct the unit-specific results. 

### ANALYSIS CODE
The R markdown files are the code I used for analysis. They follow the same pattern. The only difference is that the treated unit varies. Also, the code for the main outcome figures and robustness checks is provided.
